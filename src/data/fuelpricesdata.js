    paragraph: `Over the last few decades, fluctuations have existed in prices
        of fuel in Nigeria but has averaged at a price of 
        0.43 USD per litre 
        from 1991 until 2021, with its highest ever being 0.73 USD
        per litre in May, 2016 and its lowest ever being 0.02 USD per
        litre in December, 1992. Nigeria is one of the countries where
        the prices of its domestic oils has been on the increase since
        1970. Incessant increase in the price of crude oil has led to
        multiple negative effects on the economy from increase in the
        cost of living, to increase in the cost of production as well as
        transportation and inflation rate.`,

    paragraph: `Currently, fuel pump prices in Nigeria stand at: Gasoline/
        petrol price: N165.8/litre Diesel price: N289.4/litre Kerosene
        price: N468.0 Findings show that these prices place Nigeria as
        the seventh cheapest nation in terms of fuel pump price and the
        lowest in West Africa.`,

    paragraph: `Unlike most products, oil prices are not determined entirely by
        supply, demand, and market sentiment toward the physical
        product. Rather, supply, demand, and sentiment toward oil future
        contracts, which are traded heavily by speculators, play a
        dominant role in price determination. A change in fuel price has
        a great effect on the GDP (gross domestic product) of the
        country, paying high prices for petrol and using less of it will
        affect the demand for goods and services. Nigeria is known more
        as a consuming nation than a producing nation. The production
        industries In Nigeria face a daunting challenge to stay in
        business due to the high cost of production.`,

    paragraph: `The effects on demand, however, have a great potential impact on
        GDP in the short run. In a perfect world, using less energy has
        only a small direct effect on production because, of all the
        inputs to production (labor, equipment, energy, and other raw
        materials), energy costs account for a relatively small share of
        output, but In the case of Nigeria, energy is a major share of
        output, as organizations have to provide for their own power
        in-house, with the use of alternative power supply, such as
        generators and are exposed to the market as it relates to energy
        prices with the subsidy gone. The effects on demand and the
        consequent indirect effects on production—could be a much bigger
        problem, since spending more on petroleum imports and the
        nation’s poor power sector will generally reduce spending on
        goods and services in Nigeria while it will increase prices on
        virtually every good and service.`,
